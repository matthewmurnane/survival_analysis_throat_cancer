```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE)

pharynx <- read_csv("../data/pharynx.csv")
```

```{r}
#How many censor?
table(pharynx$Status)
```
 53 censored observations

```{r}
# treatment vs standard
table(pharynx$Tx)
```

Pretty balanced. 100 people have the standard treatment and 95 have the test.
